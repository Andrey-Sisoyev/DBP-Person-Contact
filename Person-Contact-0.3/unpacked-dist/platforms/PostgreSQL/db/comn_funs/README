-- VERY BASIC INFORMATION --
--

In order to compile and install this module you need to run the following
command from a (root) Unix-like shell

USE_PGXS=1 make install

In order to enable the module with its SQL interface you need to run the
following command from your (non-mandatory root) shell

psql <connection string> -f $(pg_config --sharedir)/contrib/comn_funs.sql <database>

Remember that this command needs to be run again if you DROP and reCREATE a
database, unless you run the above command into the template1 database.
To uninstall and disable the module you need to run the following:

psql <connection string> -f $(pg_config --sharedir)/contrib/uninstall_comn_funs.sql

All functions will be available into the pst schema and need thus to be called
like this:

SELECT * FROM comn_funs.format( 'Hello %! Now it is %','world',NOW() );
